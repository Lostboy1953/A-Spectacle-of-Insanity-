<h1>Night Life Mood.
    This 1 minute clip scratches my itch for fashion, dance, and a slight flare of lust.
    All brought together in one sequence leaves an impression of inspiration and life that I can 
    reflect when I go out at night. The words "Money cant buy happiness, but it can rent you
    paradise" resonates in my mind.
